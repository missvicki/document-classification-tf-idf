# document-classification-tf-idf

Explore how term-document matrices and weightings can be used for document classification. You will be attempting to distinguish between documents
from different categories in the Brown corpus.
Use the provided script as a starting point. Before beginning, read and
understand what itâ€™s doing. Then implement three sorts of document vectors:
1. Raw counts of terms in each document.
2. TF-IDF weighting, using the specific scheme described by Jurafsky and
Martin (ch. 6).
3. Another weighting of your own invention/discovery. This may be another
TF-IDF variant, or something else entirely!
